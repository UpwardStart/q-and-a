        possess qualities that make you a desirable tutor we encourage you to apply!

        That being said, Q&A is very meticulous about choosing the people we work with. We
        aim to provide the highest possible standards of tutoring available to customers. To
        be considered as a candidate for Q&A Tutoring you must demonstrate with tangible
        proof your abilities to be an expert in your subject matter as well as showcase your
        ability to make students feel comfortable through your approachable and friendly
        personality. You will go through an examination process as well as two separate
        interviews to determine if you are a qualified prospect. We also require transcripts
        that show a high level of success in academics in order to solidify your proven
        expertise in the subject matter you are applying for.

        We are well aware of the extremely high value that a good, qualified tutor brings to
        the table. So to support such high standards we back our requirements up with
        extremely competitive compensation. We also realize that tutors of such standards
        are likely pursuing higher education or a career so in order to accommodate our
        tutors also set their own hours and have the right to a flexible schedule
      </p>

        We look forward to hearing from you!
